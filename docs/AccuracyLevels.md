## Accuracy Levels
In CSMark, there are a variety of accuracy levels to cater towards different needs.

These are given short names so that anybody using CSMark can easily know what accuracy level someone is talking about.

Accuracy Levels are used to allow users to control how accurate the results of a test can be depending on their use case. These accuracy levels change the ``Maximum Iterations`` setting for CSMark when benchmarking.

CSMark uses accuracy levels to determine how many times a benchmark test has to be run. [CSMark Scores]() use the amount of time taken to complete the number of tests specified. Using a higher accuracy level can result in a benchmark run taking longer but also can result in a somewhat more accurate test since more benchmark tests being run over a longer period of time can provide a more accurate result.

### CM Accuracy Levels
These are intended for use in a quick benchmarking session and in user reviews (depending on accuracy level).
The accuracy levels in this category are: CM1, CM2, CM3, CM4, and CM5. The higher the number at the end of the CM level, the more accurate it is.
This accuracy level is typically for laptops and low end to mid range desktop PCs. Attempting to run this on hardware which substantially more capable than this can result in a lower accuracy of results due to how fast it can complete the tests.

### PX Accuracy Levels
These are intended for use in professional user reviews or media outlet reviews. The accuracy levels in this category are: PX1, PX2, PX3, PX4, and PX5.
The higher the number at the end of the PX level, the more accurate it is. This accuracy level is typically for mid range to high end Desktop PCs. Attempting to run this on hardware which is substantially more capable than this, such as server grade hardware, can result in a lower accuracy of results due to how fast it can complete the tests.

### WX Accuracy Levels
These are intended for use in professional server grade hardware reviews such as a review of a 32 Core CPU or a system with multiple sockets and multiple CPUs in it.
This can also be used for OEM product testing. The higher the number at the end of the WX level, the more accurate it is. The accuracy levels in this category are: WX1, WX2, WX3, WX4, WX5, WX6, WX7, WX8, WX9, WX10, WX11, and WX12. The higher the number at the end of the WX level, the more accurate it is.
This accuracy level is typically for server grade hardware such as systems with Up To 8 Sockets and Up To 8 CPUs with Up To 32 Cores each. Attempting to run this on hardware which is substantially more capable than this can result in a lower accuracy of results due to how fast it can complete the tests.
