### OS versions we've never supported

| OS Name | OS Version | Reason why it was never supported|
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Windows | Vista SP2 | DotNetCore 1.1 did not support Vista and no newer version does. | 
| Ubuntu | 14.04 LTS | I don't think this is still incredibly popular and support ends for it from Canonical before CSMark Release support may end. |
