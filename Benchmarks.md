* Trigonometry - This uses lengths of a triangle to calculate an angle.
* Percentage Error based benchmark which involves calculating the percentage difference between 2 given numbers.
* A Multi Threaded version of all the above benchmarks.

### Benchmarking Tests to be added
* Differentiating with respect to X (Possibly)
* Solving for X (Possibly)
* Solving Simultaneous Equations (Possibly)
