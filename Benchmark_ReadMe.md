# Benchmarks ReadMe
All benchmarks included in CSMark are written in C# and are designed to be scalable and/or repeatable.

### Benchmarks included so far:
* Pythagoras based benchmark which involves calculating either the length of the hypotenuse, adjacent length or opposite length.
* Trigonometry based benchmark which involves calculating the size of an angle based on any 2 of: hypotenuse, adjacent or opposite sides.
* Percentage Error based benchmark which involves calculating the percentage difference between 2 given numbers.
* Arithmetic Sum N based benchmark which involves calculating the sum of N number of objects in an arithmetic sequence.
* FizzBuzz based benchmark which involves finding each multiple of 3, 5 and integers which are multiple of 3 and 5.
