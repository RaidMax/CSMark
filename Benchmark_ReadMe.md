# Benchmarks ReadMe
All benchmarks included in CSMark are written in C# and are designed to be scalable and/or repeatable.

### Benchmarks included so far:
* Pythagoras based benchmark which involves calculating either the length of the hypotenuse, adjacent length or opposite length.
* Trigonometry based benchmark which involves calculating the size of an angle based on any 2 of: hypotenuse, adjacent or opposite sides.
* Percentage Error based benchmark which involves calculating the percentage difference between 2 given numbers.
* Arithmetic Sum N based benchmark which involves calculating the sum of N number of objects in an arithmetic sequence.
* FizzBuzz based benchmark which involves finding each multiple of 3, 5 and integers which are multiple of 3 and 5.

### Benchmarks which have been introduced:

* Difficulty Level refers to how demanding the benchmark is relatively speaking

| Benchmark Name | Added in | Removed in | Status | Difficulty Level| Notes |

| Pythagoras | 0.1.0.0 | - |  Maintained | DL 1 |
| Trigonometry | 0.2.0.0 | - | Maintained | DL 1| |
| Gradient | 0.4.0.0 | 0.5.0.0 | Discontinued |DL 0 | |
| PercentageError | 0.6.0.0 | -| Maintained |DL 1 | |
| ArithmeticSumN | 0.10.0.0 | - | Maintained | DL 1 | |
| FizzBuzz | 0.13.0.0 | - | Maintained| DL 2 | Could possibly removed in the future due to how much it can affect the CSMark Points sore. |
