## CSMark Roadmap

### CSMark 1.0 Roadmap
* __Increasing Viability as a Benchmark for use in Reviews__ by providing a more stable, usable and feature rich application that is intuitive and easy to use. Reviewers and individuals wanting to test CPUs need a reliable product to confidently say how specific CPUs perform. Using an unstable benchmark or a constantly changing benchmark means that mistakes could be made and/or it could lead to inaccurate findings. This needs to be avoided at all costs and stability is of the utmost importance.
* __A better Scoring System__ . A better scoring system is required to ensure more consistent results along with making benchmarks run multiple times and getting the average before giving the user the results. More benchmarks are also needed to ensure that the resulting overall scores from any given tests are more accurate and less dependant on other tests.
If a single test in a benchmark run has signifcantly higher results than in a previous run, this could lead to drastic overall score differences and thus more tests are needed to provide a more accurate and reflective overall score.
* __Making it more attractive for most users__ . Normal users might use CSMark if they found out from a reviewer information about it or want to compare the reviewer's score with their own CPU.
If normal users are going to use this application, it needs to be available on more platforms in different versions. A Console Application is perfectly usable for power users and those who are generally comfortable using PCs.
The problem arises for casual users or non-power users who may not be as comfortable with a Console Application. To solve this issue in the short term, a UWP application is in the works which will be able to run the same set of calculations and tests.
In the long term, it is believed that Xamarin (what the UWP app will use) or Microsoft through DotNetCore may support a cross-platform Desktop GUI as Xamarin is only currently cross-platform for Mobile OS and Windows 10 Devices.
* __A Proper Support System in Place__ . CSMark needs a proper support sysyem in place such as a forum or dedicated email address. CSMark could benefit from a website as well but this would require CSMark to be monetized. The Discord server created could work as a form of support but it would require more users to be practical for people to use to get support.

### CSMark 2.0 Roadmap
* __Possibly the addition of a GPU Benchmark__ to provide a more extensive benchmark suite. This is a possibility and may not be persued.
